# Stable Diffusion Framework

This project implements a Stable Diffusion-based framework for generating high-quality, photorealistic images from text descriptions. It evaluates performance using FID and Inception Score, ensuring image diversity and quality. 

## Features
- Generates photorealistic images from textual prompts.
- Evaluates image quality using FID and Inception Score metrics.
- Addresses limitations of traditional generative models like GANs and VAEs.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
